## Overview

Exactly as this project's name, easy-emoji provide some solutions which displaying a emoji on old system or 
browser, and it is easy to integrate it to your project.

If you have curiosities for the problems that some older system or browser cannot display certain emoji, you could read 
the [blog](https://tongdada.github.io/2020/04/01/all-about-emoji/) named `All about emoji` by me.

## Usage

Firstly, ensure that you already installed it on your project, otherwise use the command in your project.

`npm i easy-emoji -S`

### Image Mode

#### load ALl
```jsx harmony
import easyEmoji from "easy-emoji";
const imgMode = easyEmoji("img");
const { emojiData } = imgMode;
function renderEmojiList() {
	return <ul className={"easy-emoji-list"}>
                {
               	    emojiData.map(({ name, alies, id }) => {
               	    	return  <li
                           key={id}
                           className={"emoji"}
                           data-emoji-name={name}
                           id={`e_${id}`}
                        > </li>
               	    })
               	}
    </ul>
}
```

For above example, apparently we only need the emojiData to map its styles to the element, yeah, it's enough for some 
simple situations, actually it load a **sprites** which including 877 emojis and the size is about 800+kb and 2.4MB
corresponding to `1x.png` and `2x.png`.

#### Load one or a specific list

So, if you do not need such much of emojis, you can provide a list indicating what emojis you want to use, in this case, 
easy does `not load the sprites`, it will load one by one for the list you provided. This is a example for the 
situation.

```jsx harmony
import easyEmoji from "easy-emoji";
const imgMode = easyEmoji("img");
const { getEmojiData } = imgMode;
const emojiList = getEmojiData(3, 5); // or getEmojiData([3,4,5]);
// ... Ignoring render process that rendering the emojiList data, the behavior as same as above example.
```

ðŸš€ Wow, it appears very amazing, and we could also deeply into `easy-emoji`.
